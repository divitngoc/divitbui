			<p class="bio">Hi, I'm Divit Bui. I am a self-taught Software Engineer that's loves to learn and teach!
				I've started coding around 2018 and I have professional experience in system design, architecture, databases and applications.
				<br/>
				Currently I work with Java using Springboot Framework where my main responsibility at the moment is to do with API Design.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				As I mentioned, I love to learn and I thirst for knowledge (MORE POWER!!) thus I dabble in a lot of different areas of technology so be sure to check out my Github for more. It includes Machine Learning with pytorch, Quarkus with Kafka, Android applications and many more!
				
				<br/>
				<br/>
				I've graduated with a BEng in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Salford which totally doesn't make much sense with my Career path, I know!
				I didn't know I would fall in love with programming when I tried it which wasn't till few years after my graduation.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Personally, I know the struggle starting off to code, getting "stuff" to just work and trying to understand why. 
				I have been in that situation and I know it can be tough so whether you're self-taught, in bootcamp or University, you can contact me via email or linkedin and I would be happy to help in your journey!
				
				<br/>
				<br/>
				That's all for now, thanks for reading!
